# Code for Change - Shine On! Kids

This is the Code for Change 2017 project for Shine On! Kids (http://sokids.org/).

#### Scope of Work:
  
**Donors Management Tool (Platform: Web)​**
* Confirmation Mail​
  * Send a confirmation mail when “Team Beads of Courage” registration is done. Google Form is now used for registration. Donors sometimes register multiple times by mistake, because no confirmation is sent​
* Delivery Mail​
  * Implement a function to generate/send mails automatically. When a donor registers “Team Beads of Courage” program, SOK delivers 2 beads to the donor after 3,000yen donation.  When SOK sends beads to donors, they need to create/send mails one by one now. ​
* Donors Management Screen​
  * When the same donors register the program multiple times, it is recorded as a new line at the bottom of Google Form. Therefore, it’s difficult to track who registers how many times​
  * Add a sequence no for each donor so that they can manage the history of donation / activities etc.​
  * Shine On! Kids send a strap when the same donor registers the program 10 times, but it is currently difficult to manage the counts
